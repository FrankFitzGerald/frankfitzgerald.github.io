My name is **Frank FitzGerald**, and this is my personal blog. It currently has {{ site.posts | size }} posts in {{ site.index | size }} categories which combinedly have {{ total_words }} words, which will take an average reader ({{ site.wpm }} WPM) approximately <span class="time">{{ total_readtime }}</span> minutes to read. {% if featuredcount != 0 %}There are <a href="{{ site.url }}/featured">{{ featuredcount }} featured posts</a>, you should definitely check those out.{% endif %} The most recent post is {% for post in site.posts limit:1 %}{% if post.description %}<a href="{{ site.url }}{{ post.url }}" title="{{ post.description }}">"{{ post.title }}"</a>{% else %}<a href="{{ site.url }}{{ post.url }}" title="{{ post.description }}" title="Read more about {{ post.title }}">"{{ post.title }}"</a>{% endif %}{% endfor %} which was published on {% for post in site.posts limit:1 %}{% assign modifiedtime = post.modified | date: "%Y%m%d" %}{% assign posttime = post.date | date: "%Y%m%d" %}<time datetime="{{ post.date | date_to_xmlschema }}" class="post-time">{{ post.date | date: "%d %b %Y" }}</time>{% if post.modified %}{% if modifiedtime != posttime %} and last modified on <time datetime="{{ post.modified | date: "%Y-%m-%d" }}" itemprop="dateModified">{{ post.modified | date: "%d %b %Y" }}</time>{% endif %}{% endif %}{% endfor %}. The last commit was on {{ site.time | date: "%A, %d %b %Y" }} at {{ site.time | date: "%I:%M %p" }} [UTC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time "Temps Universel Coordonn√©").

I have a B.A. in *Digital Media* from [UCF](http://www.UCF.edu/) at **University of Central Florida**. I have always been curious about technology which led me to Digital Media, which encompasses everything form website development to the actual design. I am currently employed as a Communications Specialist using my degree in Digital Media to keep my coworkers and team informed with various media.
