My name is **Frank FitzGerald**, and this is my personal blog. It currently has {{ site.posts | size }} posts in {{ site.categories | size }} categories which combinedly have {{ total_words }} words, which will take an average reader ({{ site.wpm }} WPM) approximately <span class="time">{{ total_readtime }}</span> minutes to read. {% if featuredcount != 0 %}There are <a href="{{ site.url }}/featured">{{ featuredcount }} featured posts</a>, you should definitely check those out.{% endif %} The most recent post is {% for post in site.posts limit:1 %}{% if post.description %}<a href="{{ site.url }}{{ post.url }}" title="{{ post.description }}">"{{ post.title }}"</a>{% else %}<a href="{{ site.url }}{{ post.url }}" title="{{ post.description }}" title="Read more about {{ post.title }}">"{{ post.title }}"</a>{% endif %}{% endfor %} which was published on {% for post in site.posts limit:1 %}{% assign modifiedtime = post.modified | date: "%Y%m%d" %}{% assign posttime = post.date | date: "%Y%m%d" %}<time datetime="{{ post.date | date_to_xmlschema }}" class="post-time">{{ post.date | date: "%d %b %Y" }}</time>{% if post.modified %}{% if modifiedtime != posttime %} and last modified on <time datetime="{{ post.modified | date: "%Y-%m-%d" }}" itemprop="dateModified">{{ post.modified | date: "%d %b %Y" }}</time>{% endif %}{% endif %}{% endfor %}. The last commit was on {{ site.time | date: "%A, %d %b %Y" }} at {{ site.time | date: "%I:%M %p" }} [UTC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time "Temps Universel Coordonné").

I have a B.A. in *Digital Media* from [UCF](http://www.UCF.edu/) at **University of Central Florida**. I have always been curious about technology which led me to Digital Media, which encompasses everything form website development to the actual design. I am currently employed as a Communications Specialist using my degree in Digital Media to keep my coworkers and team informed with various media.

At some point in the not-terribly-distant future, I hope to find a self-sustaining collective of clever people, for fun, profit(?), and the promotion of living a happy & meaningful life. This might find me in the SF Bay Area, Japan, Germany, or the dustbin of overly idealistic plan.(Yes, I have a special bin for overly idealistic plans. The most challenging aspect of this concept is to curtail unproductive competition with other people who will inevitably have the same idea. (Some sort of cooperative federation...) I'm always looking for people who might be interested in being a part of such an organization.

Anyways, for now I'm just working toward being an overall good designer & coder. Not that I necessarily expect to succeed, but it's something to strive for, and it's a fun problem to work on.

I
make
stuff.


*Beautiful, practical, meaningful stuff.*


I make what I love.

*I love what I do.*


But over the years, I noticed that somehow, along the way, software designed to help us be creative, actually made us less creative. That's because we believe our best ideas emerge when we use pencils and paper.
So I set out to build tools that work the way I do.


Tools for the creative space — the 53 centimeters that magically link head, heart, and hand. Tools as simple as pencil and paper. Tools so essential, I  really can't imagine work without them.


For
the makers,  
the creators,  
the discoverers,  
the original thinkers,  
***This is the space to create.***
